I make a lot of changes to this project

I think that it deviated from the original intention of doing this project.

I just want to reproduce the configuration of `Lazyvim` , and learn how to configure the `neovim`.

but I always want to make some things for myself which escape the `lazyvim`.

so I decided to change this project name

I do something  for my config.
